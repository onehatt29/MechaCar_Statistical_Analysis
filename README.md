# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
⦁	Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
⦁	  
⦁	
1.	Vehicle_Weight and Spoiler_angle pr(>|t|) both have coefficients of 0
⦁	Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
       2.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
 
 
The overall variance of all the lots indicates that the manufactoring data meets the design specification,
Based on the data, the Variance Suspension coils for lot 1 and lot 2 meet psi requirements
However Lot3 is under the psi of 1500.

The Varience of the suspension coil data set is 62% of a differnce between lot1 to lot3


## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

 The t-test for lot 1 producess a mean x vaule of 1500 which is equal to the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

Lot2 T-test comes in at slightly over the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.
lot3 is slightly under population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch
