1.	Vehicle_Weight and Spoiler_angle pr(>|t|) both have coefficients of 0
⦁	Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
       2.
1.	
⦁	Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

 


 
The overall variance of all the lots indicates that the manufactoring data meets the design specification,
Based on the data, the Variance Suspension coils for lot 1 and lot 2 meet psi requirements
However Lot3 is under the psi of 1500.

The Varience of the suspension coil data set is 62% of a differnce between lot1 to lot3


## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

 The t-test for lot 1 producess a mean x vaule of 1500 which is equal to the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

Lot2 T-test comes in at slightly over the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.
lot3 is slightly under population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch

 ## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

# In  order to compare the MechaCar to the Competition there are certain metrics that are required.
## To compare the MechaCar to the Competition certain metrics are required.
The study would require data of what is most desired from the customer, such as gas mileage, comfort, speed, Manufacturer warranty, maintenance cost, and purchase rebates.
To obtain these metrics I would test the gas milage and maintenance cost of the competition.
The alternative hypothesis of these metrics would be gas mileage, maintenance cost, and manufacturer warranty. 

For this test I would use Hypothesis testing that will test for Specify the Null Hypothesis, Specify the Alternative Hypothesis, Set the Significance Level, Calculate the Test Statistic and Corresponding P-Value
